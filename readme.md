# Logseq Plugin Refactor Hierarchy

Work in Progress

## What is this plugin?

This plugin was inspired by [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/) [Refactor Hierarchy](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/9zwkp44wnlaa8p8dpt4w8tq/) functionality.

My goal with this plugin is to provide a better way to batch rename Logseq notes (and probably do mass operations on tags in near future).

## How to install this plugin?

Right now to install this plugin you have to:

- clone this repository
- install dependencies running `pnpm install`
- build the plugin using `pnpm build`
- add it to logseq, you probably can find more information [here](https://gist.github.com/xyhp915/bb9f67f5b430ac0da2629d586a3e4d69)
